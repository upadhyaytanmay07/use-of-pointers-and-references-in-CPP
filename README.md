# Aim
To study and implement the applications of pointers in C++, including call by value, call by reference, and practical use cases such as a salary incrementer.

# Software Used
Compiler: GNU GCC (g++)

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Operating System: Windows/Linux

# Theory
# 1. Call by Value
In call by value, a function receives a copy of the actual arguments.

Any changes made inside the function do not affect the original variables.

It is safe but memory inefficient when handling large data.

Example:

    void swap(int x, int y){
        int temp = x;
        x = y;
        y = temp;
    }
After execution, values inside main() remain unchanged.

# 2. Call by Reference
In call by reference, the function receives the memory address of arguments using pointers.

Changes in the function directly affect the original variables.

Achieved using pointer parameters or reference variables.

Example:

    void swap(int *a, int *b){
        int temp = *a;
        *a = *b;
        *b = temp;
    }
Here, swapping works successfully since we modify values at given memory locations.

# 3. Practical Application â€“ Salary Incrementer
Pointers are also used in real-world problems, such as updating salary records.

A pointer is passed to the function, and the salary value is modified in-place.

Example: Applying a 20% increment when an employee meets given conditions (years worked, profit generated, research projects).

    void comp(float *salary){
        *salary = *salary + (0.2 * (*salary));
    }
